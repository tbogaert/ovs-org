### Committing Code

Open vStorage is an open source project so we welcome all contributions
but sending a maintainer a patch, or a pull request that consists of
your "fix" mixed with a dozen renames, refactoring changes, variable
renames, method renames, file splitting, layout changing code is not
really a contribution, it is home work. If you want to commit code, send
a pull request to incorporate your code in the Open vStorage project.
Before creating a pull request, you should compare your outgoing
requests to the destination repository. This tells you how much the
destination repository changed while you worked on your fork or branch.
You do this by comparing incoming changes.It is good practice to make
sure that there are no incoming changes before you make your pull
request.

To create a pull request on Bitbucket, do the following:

-   Navigate to the repository with the changes.
-   Press the Pull Request button.
-   The system displays the request form. Complete the form as
    appropriate for your request.
-   Press Create pull request.
-   The system opens your latest request on the Pull Request page of the
    original repository.
-   To see the list of all the pull requests against this repository,
    click Pull Requests in the navigation bar. The Bitbucket system also
    sent a notification email to your account Inbox.
-   Go ahead and open your account inbox avatar \> Inbox.
-   Locate and review the pull request email (it should be near the
    top).
-   Adjust the Source branch if necessary.
-   Adjust the Destination repository or branch if necessary.
-   Enter a Title and Description for your pull request.
-   Press Create pull request.
