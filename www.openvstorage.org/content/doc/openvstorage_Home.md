This section is intended for (End-) Users who want to implement and
manage Open vStorage. You can learn what is needed to setup Open
vStorage, add your first Storage Backend and create your first vMachine.
Once everything is setup you can use the GUI to follow up on how things
are running and be amazed of the IOPS Open vStorage is giving you. In
case you want to integrate your applications with Open vStorage, no
problem as we have a well documented [API](/doc/Using%20the%20API).
More acquainted with command line? No problem Open vStorage comes with
an interactive python [command line](/doc/Using%20the%20CLI). Having
an issue with Open vStorage? Check the [Support](/doc/Support)
section.

ask questions but even better would be if you would take the time to
answer questions.
