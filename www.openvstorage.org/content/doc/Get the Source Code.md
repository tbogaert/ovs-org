===================

Ok, so you have read [the rules](/doc/The%20Rules) and want to contribute
code to the Open vStorage Project? in that case you need to fork the
Open vStorage project on Bitbucket.

To fork the Open vStorage repository, do the following:

-   Go to
    [<https://bitbucket.org/openvstorage/openvstorage>](https://bitbucket.org/openvstorage/openvstorage)
-   Click the Fork button. The Bitbucket system displays the Fork
    dialog:
-   Define options for your fork.
-   Press Fork repository. The Bitbucket system will create the fork and
    the Overview page is opened.

More info on forking can be found at the [Bitbucket
website](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Forking+a+Repository).
