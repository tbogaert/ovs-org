File a Bug
==========

Open vStorage is not perfect and so there will be bugs in the software.
The Open vStorage Project maintains a public issue tracker where you can
report bugs and request features. This issue tracker is not a customer
support forum but an error, flaw, failure, or fault in the Open vStorage
software. To improve Open vStorage it is essential that bugs are tracked
and thereafter solved in a timely manner. Before you file a bug, please
check if it was not filed before so we can keep the number of bugs
manageable. [You can find all bugs which are not yet solved
here](https://bitbucket.org/openvstorage/openvstorage/issues?status=new&status=open).

So you found a bug which isn't yet in the issue tracker? Great! Please
create a new bug by selecting the *Create issue button* and file a good
bug report. A good bug report contain:

-   A clear description as title of the problem
-   What are the steps to reproduce the problem? Please add code or
    hints on how to reproduce it.
-   What was the expected result?
-   What happens instead?
-   If applicable, the OS, hardware or configuration the issue is
    occurring on.

In case a bug report doesn't contain enough information for anyone to
take action on, it will likely be ignored alas.

Don't forget to vote for bugs you encounter in the field. The more votes
a bug gets, the likelier someone will pick it up.

Are you looking for support? Have a look or leave a message in the
public [Open vStorage discussion
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-vstorage). You can
ask questions but even better would be if you would take the time to
answer questions.
