### Storage Router
* A Storage Router is the intelligence between your virtual machines and your preferred storage backends.

* The Storage Router goes much beyond just being an interface â€“ it performs functions such as flash acceleration, clustering and redundancy, replication/backup, snapshots, clones, compression, encryption and a unified namespace.

### Open Source

* Our goal behind Open vStorage is not only build something open and non-proprietary but something modular enough which allows developers to innovate on top of Open vStorage.

* We believe with contributors from the open source community Open vStorage can become a far superior software compared to proprietary offerings.

### Storage Intelligence

* Open vStorage is much more than a caching system.

* Open vStorage has the intelligence of a full storage system like a high-end SAN and combines flash acceleration, storage tiering, replication, snapshots, clones, storage clustering, unified namespace completely replacing the need for dual controller based systems.

### Multiple Storage Backends

* While using local disks may seem like the best scenario, enterprises and service providers have made huge investments in NAS and distributed filesystems.

* Open vStorage new and high-tech functionality with existing Backends. Even S3 compatible Object Stores. All the customer will have to add is servers with flash memory close to the HyperVisor.
