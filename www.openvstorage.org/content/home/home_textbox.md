## Welcome to the Open vStorage community website

Open vStorage is an open-source VM storage router for Virtual Machines. It is a software layer (called the VM Storage Router) that is installed on a host or cluster of hosts on which Virtual Machines are running. These VM Storage Routers (VSRs) operate like a grid leveraging local flash memory or SSDs and any storage back-end (S3 compatible object store, (distributed) filesystem, NAS) to provide an extremely high performance and reliable storage system as compared to buying expensive SANs or NAS for VM storage.

Conceptually Open vStorage is similar to VMware vSAN, though weâ€™ve tried to make it a lot more flexible by giving the ability to leverage multiple storage back-ends (and not just locally attached disks) and supporting multiple hypervisors.
