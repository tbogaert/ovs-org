### Committing Code
Open vStorage is an open source project so we welcome all contributions but sending a maintainer a patch, or a pull request that consists of your “fix” mixed with a dozen renames, refactoring changes, variable renames, method renames, file splitting, layout changing code is not really a contribution, it is home work. If you want to commit code, send a pull request to incorporate your code in the Open vStorage project. Before creating a pull request, you should compare your outgoing requests to the destination repository. This tells you how much the destination repository changed while you worked on your fork or branch. You do this by comparing incoming changes.It is good practice to make sure that there are no incoming changes before you make your pull request.

To create a pull request on Bitbucket, do the following:
* Navigate to the repository with the changes.
* Press the Pull Request button.
* The system displays the request form. Complete the form as appropriate for your request.
* Press Create pull request.
* The system opens your latest request on the Pull Request page of the original repository.
* To see the list of all the pull requests against this repository, click Pull Requests in the navigation bar. The Bitbucket system also sent a notification email to your account Inbox.
* Go ahead and open your account inbox avatar > Inbox.
* Locate and review the pull request email (it should be near the top).
* Adjust the Source branch if necessary.
* Adjust the Destination repository or branch if necessary.
* Enter a Title and Description for your pull request.
* Press Create pull request.

### File a Bug
Open vStorage is quality checked to the highest level. Unfortunately we might have overlooked some tiny topics here or there. The Open vStorage Project maintains a public issue tracker where you can report bugs and request features. This issue tracker is not a customer support forum but an error, flaw, failure, or fault in the Open vStorage software. To improve Open vStorage it is essential that bugs are tracked and thereafter solved in a timely manner. Before you file a bug, please check if it was not filed before so we can keep the number of bugs manageable. [You can find all bugs which are not yet solved here](https://bitbucket.org/openvstorage/openvstorage/issues?status=new&status=open).

So you found a bug which isn’t yet in the issue tracker? Great! Please create a new bug by selecting the Create issue button and file a good bug report. A good bug report contain:
* A clear description as title of the problem
* What are the steps to reproduce the problem? Please add code or hints on how to reproduce it.
* What was the expected result?
* What happens instead?
* If applicable, the OS, hardware or configuration the issue is occurring on.
* In case a bug report doesn’t contain enough information for anyone to take action on, it will likely be ignored alas.

Don’t forget to vote for bugs you encounter in the field. The more votes a bug gets, the likelier someone will pick it up.
Are you looking for support? Have a look or leave a message in the public [Open vStorage discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-vstorage). You can ask questions but even better would be if you would take the time to answer questions.
